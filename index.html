                         <p class="passage">We are a non-profit organisation that is founded on the strength and 
			           resilience of a woman – so it was only natural for us to pursue the empowerment of young 
			           and vulnerable girls, starting from our community.<br><br>
                          The Groom a Girl Initiative Team are committed to bringing about change and making a visible 
			           difference in as many young girls’ lives as we possibly can. We provide assistance to 
			           young girls who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, whether they are orphaned or have 
			           parents that are unable to care for them due to unfortunate circumstances. We help by
			           providing them with the basic necessities that are very important to every young and 
			           developing girl through our year-long Pad-Drive and Toiletry-Drive. <br><br>
                          I believe if you put the things that matter the msot first, you will always succeed.
                          Your heart will never lead you astray if you nurture it and feel it with love and
                          positivity. Follow it, always, and shape your mind to listen to the heart not fight
                          it. For that is the secret to a fulfilling life with an abundance of joy and happiness.
                          This is an close as we will get to a peaceful life for all, if we all show love and follow
                          our hearts.<br><br>
			           Being part of the development of young girls is an intricate task that requires you to not 
			           just physically help them, but also cater to their emotional needs. We aim to instil in them 
			           a positive attitude and outlook on life, because after all, despite one’s background and circumstances, 
			           you will always be able to reach your goals and prosper in life with a good attitude. 
			           So, as part of our initiative, we invest time in helping each one of our girls individually, 
			           focusing on their strengths and encouraging them to be the best versions of themselves. 
			           This allows them to understand that, despite their circumstances, there is a world 
			           filled with opportunity and that they can prosper with the right guidance, mindset,
 			           focus and work ethic.<br><br>
			           Our long-term goal is to open our own centre where we can continue to operate our initiative on our own grounds, 
			           creating a tangible place that a girl in need can run to, as a ‘sister-centre’.
			           The team at Groom a Girl Initiative stand firm in the belief that one is not defined by their past or current circumstances – 
			           and more importantly, we want our young girls to know that there is nothing that they cannot achieve, 
			           irrespective of the challenges that they have and may continue to face.<br><br>
			           Groom A Girl Initiative wishes to empower young girls in making positive life choices through mentoring, educational activities, 
			           support systems and nurturance. We aim to empower girls by bringing out their beauty and individual potential from within. 
			           We want to help change the lives of many young girls by helping them realize their unlimited power as women, 
                          and that opportunities do exist, 
			           not because of where they come from but because of who they are.<br><br>
			           Help us guide this nation’s future generations of successful women, mothers, and leaders.<br><br>

                                   after I lost my father when I was 2 years old. My mother dedicated her life to
                                   raising my brother and I. She is the core reason for the birth of this initiative.<br><br>
                                   I want young girls in my community to know that there is more to life than their current
                                   circumstances, and that they are  not defined by their situation.
                                   There is more to life and they can achieve great thing.<br><br>
                                   We at GGI want to offer a helping hand. I hope to have our own safe home or center to be
                                   able to reach more girls out there.</p>

                 <h4>Lunch Date with our Girls</h4>
                 <div class="info">
                   <p>We were gifted the opportunity to have a lovely lunch with our girls, a few of dedicated supporter moms and 2 very well established guest speakers.
                    Everyone was served with a delicious 3 course meal, while listening to encouraging testimonies and words of wisdom from Guest speakers Nasreen having a Bachelors in Education , Intermediate Phase mathematics & Science and powerhouse Demi Harmse with masters in Politics from UJ.
                    Each Guest at the lunch received a certificate of appreciation and dedication. We were lucky enough to gift each girl with both a toiletry pack and a special box of goods containing some make-up and hair accessories.
                    The day was ended with some pictures, singing and dancing.</p>
